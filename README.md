# Custom Django Allauth, Django Rest Auth & React-Redux

Using Django django_alluth package makes it easier to authenticate users which is \
very straight forward and easy to use. Also this project integrates dj_rest_auth in \
 creating RESTFUL Apis, with direct endpoints to authenticate users and resetting \
 their passwords e.t.c.

In other section, react and redux holds state of the application for react projects.

In short this project has simplified authentication part for any project that uses \
Django and React. Other methods in JS are used for content management in Django \
templates hence improving users experience.
